#####Why should I use this starter kit?
* You're new to all this React stuff and you just want to start hacking at it straight away
* You want the latest suite of development tools available and you're tired of config shenanigans
* You <3 React.js + Alt.js + React Router
* You <3 tested code (or your company does)

#####Why should I not use this starter kit?
* This setup has been too heavily configured and exceeds your needs
